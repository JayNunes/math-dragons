# Math Dragons - Multiplication Trainer

This was a project I did while studying javascript and can be found live at [Math Dragons](https://math-dragons.netlify.app)

The task was to create something using **jQuery**, so I made a simple math game to help my daughter memorize her multiplication tables.

All the sprites were downloaded from the internet and are subject to copyright. This project is a demo only.
